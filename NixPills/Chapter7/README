# Chapter 7 Nix Pills
Run this with the command
    nix-build simple.nix

nix-build does two jobs
   - nix-instantiate : parse and evaluate simple.nix and return the .drv file corresponding to the parsed derivation set
   - nix-store -r : realise the .drv file, which actually builds it.

This'll generate the *result* directory with the ocmpiled executable inside it
